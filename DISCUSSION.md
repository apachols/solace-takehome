FWIW I made a couple of quick typing and react error fixes on main before the first PR

## Next steps

Frontend Performance:

- Add a search wizard (like in Solace production!) to narrow down to advocates in the user's state
- Add paging for search results, since there are 100k+ advocates

# Thoughts

Frontend

- As a fullstack engineer, I lean backend a bit, so I leaned on the AI for all the CSS
- My goal here is to get the styling for the takehome search page to "okay for a 2 hour prototype"
- After the "prototype" phase, I like to consult my frontend wizard teammates before styling too heavily
